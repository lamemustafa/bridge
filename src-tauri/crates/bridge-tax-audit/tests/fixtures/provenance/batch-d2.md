# Batch D2 fixture provenance: `partners_40b_194t` and `tds_interest_201`

Lane B, 2026-09-23. Every book here is invented: no fixture is a Tally read of any real assessee, and every
partner and ledger name is invented ("A Capital", "Interest to Partners", ...).

`partners_40b_194t` is ported only as `tds_interest_201`'s input (orchestrator's exception, 23-Sep-2026):
on the three real books it is real work on one (a firm); the other two are not firms or LLPs. Its parity
therefore rests on one real book, with its own edge books covering the not-applicable path and every
branch the real book does not reach. This bends the two-book bar; the owner may veto it.

## What these fixtures establish, and what they do not

- `golden/synthetic.partners_40b_194t.json` is the reference's dump on the synthetic read, an
  individual: one figure, `applicable` = "no".
- `edge-books/partners_firm_deed.json` (a firm with a deed below the statutory cap): a partner whose
  capital goes into debit for part of the year (those days count zero); a withdrawal on the first day; a
  transfer between two partners' capital; one voucher carrying both the interest and the remuneration
  ledger (read as interest); an interest journal with a TDS line under Duties & Taxes (seen) and one
  without (not seen), the latter with no voucher number; a partner naming its capital ledger twice (its
  opening counts twice) with no interest or remuneration ledger; an optional voucher on a capital
  ledger, outside the population; an s.40(b) excess and an s.194T finding.
- `edge-books/partners_llp_no_deed.json` (an LLP, no deed, rules without `[s194t]`): the deed-missing
  finding, the statutory cap used as the rate, the module's own s.194T default (flagged in the finding's
  limits), an excess reported as judgement-required, and a "TDS" ledger that is not under Duties &
  Taxes (so no TDS line is seen).
- `edge-books/partners_not_applicable.json` (a company, with partners and a deed configured): one
  figure, `applicable` = "no".
- Not reached here: a partner without `capital_ledgers`, a deed that is not a table or whose rate is not
  an integer, and rules without `[entity]`: each is refused (the reference raises), and unit tests cover
  them, as no golden can.
